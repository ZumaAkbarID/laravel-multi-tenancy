## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://blogs.sap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/00-thumbnail-1.png)

Multi-tenant architecture is an approach in software and cloud services where a single instance of an application or service serves multiple users or tenants. Here are key points about multi-tenant architecture:

Shared Infrastructure: In multi-tenant architecture, multiple users or organizations share the same infrastructure and resources, including servers, databases, and applications.

Customization: While the underlying architecture remains the same, multi-tenant applications can be customized to suit the specific needs of each tenant or user group.

Cost Efficiency: Multi-tenancy is often more cost-effective because it optimizes resource utilization by serving multiple clients from a single infrastructure.

Examples: Cloud-based services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms like Salesforce.com are examples of multi-tenant architectures.

Pros and Cons: Multi-tenancy offers benefits like scalability and cost savings, but it can also pose challenges in terms of data security and customization complexity

In summary, multi-tenant architecture is a way to efficiently deliver services to multiple users or organizations by sharing resources and customization capabilities while maintaining a common underlying infrastructure.
